### Currency Comparison USD v EURO

## TODO
- replace my react template with the skeleton of this repo
- implement the currency comparison as two circles that can overlap
  and the colors add together when they overlap
- upload to github and make in github page for it
- use configs folder instead of having the two config files at the root
- figure out where this bundle.js file came from that is in the root of the directory
